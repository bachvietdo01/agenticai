# Agentic AI Project Portfolio

1. [***multi_modal_flight_assistant***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/blob/main/multimodal_flight_assistant/README.md) utilizes OpenAI SDK to build a multimodal agents who can speaks and generates images using OpenAI models DALL-E and TTS.
2. [***engineering_team***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/engineering_team) is an "ambitious" Agentic AI project where we build with CrewAI a crew of software engineering team consisting of an engineering lead, a front-end engineer, a back-end engineer, and a test engineer. The engineering lead reads the requirements and assigns tasks to the front-end, back-end, and test engineers for implementation and testing.
3. [***personal_assistant***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/personal_assistant) is an ambitious project that leverages LangGraph to basically build a lightweight "ChatGPT" app. It is a powerful agentic AI system capable of using tools like web browsing, web search, file management, Wikipedia, and Python code execution to handle complex tasks on the user's behalf. It's essentially a lightweight automation agent. The project also incorporates Anthropic's Evaluator-Optimizer pattern to enhance performance and decision-making.
4. [***personally_you***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/personally_you) uses the OpenAI SDK to build my agentic AI alter ego, designed to answer any questions about my professional background.
5. [***research_agent***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/research_agent) is an multi-agent agentic system built with the OpenAI SDK that conducts in-depth research on any given topic and delivers a comprehensive report to my email. It orchestrates a team of intelligent agents—each with specialized roles—to search the web, analyze information, synthesize insights, and generate high-quality written content.
6. [***debate***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/debate) is a toy project with CrewAI where we create a team of three agents: a proposer, an opposer, and a judge. Given a motion, the proposer argues in favor, while the opposer argues against it. Finally, the impartial judge decides the winner.
7. [***investment_researcher***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/investment_researcher) leverages CrewAI to build a crew team consisting of a senior researcher and an analyst. The analyst starts by gathering preliminary information about a company from online sources, then hands it off to the senior researcher to compile a final report.
8. [***stock_agent***](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/agenticai/tree/main/stock_agent) utilizes CrewAI to build a team of agents, including a manager, a stock screener, a financial researcher, and a stock picker. The manager oversees the workflow and assigns tasks to the other agents. The stock screener identifies trending companies by scanning the internet. The financial researcher then conducts due diligence on those companies. Finally, the stock picker selects the most promising stocks and presents them to the user. **This agent is not finanical advice ofc**.
