After carefully evaluating the arguments presented for and against the motion of heavily regulating Agentic AI systems, I find that the case for heavy regulation is more convincing. 

The proponents of heavy regulation highlight critical concerns about safety, ethical implications, and the broader societal impact of Agentic AI systems. Their argument emphasizes that these systems possess autonomous capabilities that can significantly impact human lives. With the potential for biased decision-making in significant areas like employment, legal justice, and healthcare, the risks associated with autonomous AI are substantial. The historical context they provide underscores the dangers of unregulated technologies, which is particularly pertinent given the increasing prevalence of AI in our society.

Additionally, the ethical argument presented regarding the perpetuation of inequalities in AI development is also compelling. Regulations that promote transparency, accountability, and equitable design are essential to ensure these technologies do not exacerbate existing social disparities. The call for regulatory frameworks that protect marginalized communities further reinforces the argument that regulation is needed to leverage technology for the greater good of society.

Moreover, the societal impact of Agentic AI is profound, as it influences daily life and critical infrastructures. The need for heavy regulation to prevent issues like job displacement and privacy infringements illustrates the practical necessity of oversight in the rapid evolution of AI technologies. By regulating how these technologies are developed and utilized, society can prioritize human safety and equity, ensuring that technology serves humanity's interests.

On the contrary, while the opposing side raises valid concerns regarding innovation and the potential bureaucratic hindrance from heavy regulations, their arguments are less persuasive when weighed against the urgent need for ethical oversight in the face of powerful, autonomous technologies. The suggestion for adaptive regulation lacks the immediacy and firmness needed to tackle the pressing issues posed by Agentic AI. Innovation can and should proceed alongside thoughtful regulation; failure to do so risks allowing technology to outpace our social and ethical considerations.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of heavily regulating Agentic AI systems present a more compelling case centered on the necessity of safety, ethical responsibility, and the societal implications of these technologies. The precautionary principle demands that we act decisively to protect human interests and well-being, making robust regulation essential. Therefore, I support the motion for heavy regulation of Agentic AI systems.
