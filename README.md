# Agentic AI Project Portfolio

1. **personally_you** uses the OpenAI SDK to build my agentic AI alter ego, designed to answer any questions about my professional background.
2. **research_agent** is an multi-agent agentic system built with the OpenAI SDK that conducts in-depth research on any given topic and delivers a comprehensive report to my email. It orchestrates a team of intelligent agents—each with specialized roles—to search the web, analyze information, synthesize insights, and generate high-quality written content.
3. **debate** is a toy project with CrewAI where we create a team of three agents: a proposer, an opposer, and a judge. Given a motion, the proposer argues in favor, while the opposer argues against it. Finally, the impartial judge decides the winner.
