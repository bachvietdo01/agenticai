# accounts.py

This module contains a class `Account` that manages user accounts for a trading simulation platform. It supports basic account operations such as deposit, withdrawal, buying and selling shares, and calculating the portfolio value and profit/loss.

## Class

### Account

The `Account` class is responsible for managing a single user's account, funds, and transactions.

#### Attributes

- `account_id` (str): Unique identifier for the account.
- `balance` (float): Current balance of the user's account.
- `initial_deposit` (float): The initial amount deposited when the account was created.
- `holdings` (dict): A dictionary of the user's share holdings, where keys are stock symbols and values are quantities.
- `transactions` (list): A list to store transaction history. Each transaction is represented as a dictionary containing details of the transaction.

#### Methods

- `__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float)`: 
  - Initializes a new account with a unique `account_id` and an `initial_deposit`.
  - Sets the initial balance to `initial_deposit`.

- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`: 
  - Adds the specified `amount` to the account balance.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`: 
  - Withdraws the specified `amount` from the account if the balance is sufficient.
  - Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`: 
  - Buys `quantity` of `symbol` shares if sufficient funds are available.
  - Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`: 
  - Sells `quantity` of `symbol` shares if the user has enough shares.
  - Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

- `total_portfolio_value(self) -> float`: 
  - Calculates the total value of the portfolio by summing the current balance and the market value of all share holdings.

- `profit_or_loss(self) -> float`: 
  - Calculates the profit or loss by subtracting the initial deposit from the total portfolio value.

- `holdings_report(self) -> dict`: 
  - Provides a report of the current shares and quantities held by the user.

- `transaction_history(self) -> list`: 
  - Returns a list of all transactions made by the user.

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`: 
  - A placeholder function that returns the current price of a share for a given symbol.
  - Includes a fixed implementation for testing with set prices for AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how this module can be used in a simulation:

```python
account = Account("user123", 1000.00)
account.deposit(500.00)
account.withdraw(200.00)
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 2)
account.sell_shares("TSLA", 1)

print("Account Balance:", account.balance)
print("Portfolio Value:", account.total_portfolio_value())
print("Profit or Loss:", account.profit_or_loss())
print("Holdings:", account.holdings_report())
print("Transactions:", account.transaction_history())
```
```

The above design specifies an `Account` class capable of handling the operations described in the task. Each method is designed to ensure that user interactions comply with the rules (e.g., no overdrafts and proper management of holdings). The module is structured for easy testing and integration into larger systems.
